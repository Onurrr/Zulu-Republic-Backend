## 1. What is Zulu Republic?

[Zulu Republic](https://www.zulurepublic.io/) is an ecosystem of blockchain tools and services designed as a place where people, businesses, and organizations can thrive on their own terms. 

The current version consists of a full-featured multi-currency wallet with support for ETH and ZTX, Zulu Republic's own native currency. Additional functionality planned for future releases will be designed to build Zulu Republic into a one-stop cryptocurrency and self-sovereign digital identity hub. 

## 2. Technology

**Architecture**

With its lightweight, lean infrastructure, Zulu is built to be scalable, trustless, and secure. We are using state-of-the-art, industry leading standards and services to assure the highest level of quality.

**Private Keys**

Security is at the forefront of our services. Users' private keys are RSA encrypted using the user's password. Only the encrypted value is stored, which can only be decrypted using the user's password. We do not store passwords of any sort, authentication tokens of any sort, nor do we ever store an unencrypted version of a user's sensitive data.
